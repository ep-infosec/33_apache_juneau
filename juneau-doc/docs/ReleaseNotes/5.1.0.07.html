5.1.0.7 (Oct 5, 2014)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.7 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Improved error handling.  
		<li>New <del>ParserContext.PARSER_debug</del>and <del>SerializerContext.SERIALIZER_debug</del>.
			settings for logging additional information for debugging problems.
		<li>New <del>SERIALIZER_ignoreRecursions</del> setting for explicitly ignoring recursions when 
			serializing models.  Previously, the <jsf>SERIALIZER_detectRecursions</jsf> setting did this but now it simply looks for recursions 
			and throws exceptions when they occur.
		<li>Improved handling of <c>StackOverflowErrors</c>.  When <jsf>SERIALIZER_detectRecursions</jsf> is enabled, a useful error message
			is displayed showing the exact chain of objects that resulted in the stack overflow.
		<li>Bug fixes in {@link oaj.dto.ResultSetList} for Oracle and SQL Server.
		<li>Serializers and parsers can now access HTTP request attributes, parameters, and headers through <c>SerializerContext.getProperties()</c> and
			<c>ParserContext.getProperties()</c>.		
		<li>Removed media-type and encoding attributes from <del>SerializerContext</del> and <del>ParserContext</del>	
			since these are now available through context properties, and are typically not used.
		<li>{@link oaj.xml.XmlParser} now accepts <c>application/xml</c>.		
		<li>Improved handling of bean property serialization when multiple matching pojo filters for the bean property class exist.
		<li>Improved concurrency on BeanContext class.
		<li>Fixed bug in <del>Traversable</del> that was causing it to be executed even if the servlet extra path info was empty.
		<li>Fixed bug in <del>Traversable</del>where it was not picking up filters and properties defined on REST Java methods. 
	</ul>
