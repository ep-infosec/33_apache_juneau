5.0.0.32 (Oct 5, 2013)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.32 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			New support for generating and consuming fully-compliant JSON-Schema documents.<br>
			See <del>jsonschema</del> for information.
		</li>
		<li>
			New methods added to {@link oaj.parser.Parser}:
			<ul>
				<li><c>org.apache.juneau.parser.Parser.parseMap(Object,int,Class,Class,Class)</c></li>
				<li><c>org.apache.juneau.parser.Parser.parseCollection(Object,int,Class,Class)</c></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
			<li>
			{@link oaj.annotation.Bean @Bean} annotation can now be defined on interfaces and inherited by subclasses.
		</li>
		<li>
				Support for customizing serialized values for <c>Enums</c> through overriding <c>toString()</c> and <c>fromString()</c> on the enum class.<br>
			Previously used <c>Enum.valueOf()</c> to convert strings back into <c>Enums</c>.<br>
			Used for JSON-Schema support to allow {@link oaj.dto.jsonschema.JsonType} enum to be serialized to lowercase per the specification (e.g. <js>"string"</js> instead of <js>"STRING"</js>).
			</li>
			<li>
			<del>cognos Cognos</del> DTOs now have fluent-style bean setters.
			</li>
			<li>
			Support for generic bean objects whose type was erased at compile time.<br> 
			Previous behavior gave you an error message that the type could not be determined.<br>
			New behavior assumes a type of <c>Object</c> when the type is erased.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bug fixes:
				<ul>
					<li>
					When duplicate fluent-style setters were defined with different parameter types (e.g. <c>setFoo(Foo f)</c>, <c>setFoo(Bar b)</c>), the {@link oaj.BeanMap} API would sometime choose the wrong setter as the bean property setter. <br>
					Now validates that the setter being chosen is the one whose return type matches the property getter.
				</li>
				<li>
					Passing in <c>Accept</c> GET parameters with <js>'+'</js> (e.g. <c>&amp;Accept=text/json+simple</c>) wasn't working anymore.<br>
					The <c>Accept</c> parameter is supposed to interpret spaces as <js>'+'</js> to allow you to not have to write <c>&amp;Accept=text/json%2Bsimple</c>.
					</li>
					<li>
					Parsers would not set bean properties of abstract type {@link java.lang.Number}.<br> 
					Now it detects the numeric type based on input and sets the value accordingly.		
				</li>
				</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
