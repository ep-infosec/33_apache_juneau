5.1.0.8 (Oct 25, 2014)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.8 is a moderate update, focused primarily on performance improvements.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Improved performance on JSON and URL-Encoding parsers by approximately 50% on large data sets. 
			<ul>
				<li>Rewrote {@link oaj.parser.ParserReader} class to handle it's own buffering.
					The change allowed several optimizations to be made when dealing with JSON and URL-Encoding
					text by avoiding char array copies.  
				<li>Added a <c>estimatedSize</c> parameter to the {@link oaj.parser.Parser} parse methods to 
					optimize buffering when the input size is known beforehand.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Revamped the {@link oaj.BeanContext} API to perform better in multi-threaded environments.
			<ul>
				<li>Introduced a new <c>BeanPropertyStore</c> class that handles creation of {@link oaj.BeanContext} objects.
					This allows <c>BeanContext</c> objects to be considered immutable, and therefore cacheable/reusable by the framework.
					While this was technically possible to cache these objects beforehand, it relied on a locking mechanism to prevent bean contexts
						from being modified after being created.  The new mechanism is much more straightforward.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Modifications to the <del>client</del> APIs to make it easier to work with custom Apache HTTP clients.
			<ul>
				<li>Added overridable <del>RestClient.createHttpClient()</del>to allow customized subclasses to construct customized HTTP clients.
				<li>Removed the <c>DefaultRestClient</c> class since it's now fully redundant with <c>RestClient</c>.
				<li>Added <c>RestClient.shutdown()</c> method for cleaning up the internal HTTP client when you're done using a REST client.
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
