5.0.0.18 (Mar 27, 2013)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.18 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<p>
		The biggest change is the introduction of the <del>RdfSerializer</del> class that uses Jena to generate RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N-Tuple, N3, and Turtle output.
	</p>
	<p>
		This code should be considered prototype-quality, and subject to change in the future.<br>  
		There are plans of adding an equivalent <c>RdfParser</c> class in the future, so the serializer logic may need to be tweaked to allow POJOs to be reconstituted correctly in the parser.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <c>RdfXmlSerializer</c> class should be considered deprecated for now.<br>  
		However, I'm keeping it around, since it's considerably faster and uses far less memory than the Jena-based serializer since it serializes directly from POJOs to RDF/XML.<br> 
		It may or may not be removed in the future depending on demand.
	</p>
