<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.5 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>New <del>Redirect</del> class that simplifies performing redirections in REST methods.
		<li>New pluggable <del>ResponseHandler</del> class and <del>@RestResource(responseHandlers)</del> annotation
			for defining customer response handlers for special kinds of POJOs.
		<li>New method <del>UrlEncodingSerializer.serializeUrlPart(Object)</del>method.
		<li>New method <del>RestRequest.getServletURIBuilder()</del>for construcing servlet-based URLs more efficiently.
		<li>New method {@link oajr.RestResponse#getNegotiatedOutputStream()} that uses encoders if a match is found, 
			and {@link oajr.RestResponse#getOutputStream()} that just return the underlying output stream without any modifications.
		<li>Fixed bug where some properties were not being propagated correctly when using <del>CoreObject.setProperties(ObjectMap)</del>
			on serializer and parser subclasses.
		<li>Fixed bug in {@link oaj.html.HtmlSerializer} where URL keys in Maps were not being serialized as hyperlinks.
		<li>Fixed bug in {@link oaj.json.JsonSerializer} where <js>"_class"</js> and <js>"items"</js> attributes were not quoted in strict mode when using SERIALIZER_addClassAttrs feature.	
		<li>Fixed bug where <c>Content-Encoding</c> and<c>Character-Encoding</c> headers were being set when calling {@link oajr.RestResponse#getOutputStream()}.
			These should not be set if interacting with the output streams at a low level.
		<li>Eliminated various convenience <c>RestResponse.sendRedirect(...)</c> methods due to the introduction of the <del>Redirect</del> class.
	</ul>
