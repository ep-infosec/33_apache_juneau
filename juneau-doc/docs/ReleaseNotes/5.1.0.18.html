5.1.0.18 (Aug 5, 2015)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.18 is a minor update affecting the server component only.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Server</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Fixed bug where localized strings weren't resolving when using chained resource bundles.
		<li>Servlet and method labels and descriptions can now contain embedded string variables.
		<li>New <del>RestMethod.input()</del>and <del>RestMethod.responses()</del>
			annotations.
			These replace the various <c>description</c> annotations added 2 days ago with a simpler design.
		<li>New methods on <del>RestServlet</del>:
			<ul>
				<li><del>RestServlet.getMethodDescription(String,RestRequest)</del>so that subclasses
					can override the method description in the OPTIONS page.
				<li><del>RestServlet.createRequestVarResolver(RestRequest)</del>so that subclasses
					can override and augment the variable resolver.
				<li><del>RestServlet.resolveChild(Class)</del>and <del>RestServlet.replaceChild(RestServlet)</del>
					classes that allows customized resolution of servlet instances (e.g. if services are defined in OSGi).
			</ul> 
		<li>Reverted the <del>MethodDescription</del>back to 5.1.0.16 since it was being used by someone.
	</ul>
