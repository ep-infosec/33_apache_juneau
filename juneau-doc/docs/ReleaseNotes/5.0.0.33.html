5.0.0.33 (Oct 20, 2013)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.33 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Removed generic parameter from {@link oaj.serializer.WriterSerializer} class. 
			<ul>
				<li>
					Many of the examples in the documentation were written as follows, which resulted in "unchecked" compile warnings:<br>
					<c>WriterSerializer s = <jk>new</jk> JsonSerializer();</c><br>
					These compile warnings will now go away.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>	
		<li>
			New settings in BeanContext.  These can be applied to all serializers/parsers.
			<ul>
				<li><del>BEAN_ignoreInvocationExceptionsOnGetters</del>
				<li><del>BEAN_ignoreInvocationExceptionsOnSetters</del>
				<li><del>BEAN_notBeanPackages_add</del>
				<li><del>BEAN_notBeanPackages_remove</del>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Eliminated <c>addNotBeanClassPatterns(String...)</c> methods throughout API since these are now controlled by <del>BEAN_notBeanPackages_add</del> / <del>BEAN_notBeanPackages_remove</del> properties.
		</li>
		<li>
			New settings in <c>RestServletProperties</c>.
			<ul>
				<li><c>RestServletProperties.REST_trimTrailingUriSlashes</c><br>
					Also removed <c>RestRequest.getRequestURI(boolean trimTrailingSlashes)</c> method which is now redundant with this property.
				<li><c>RestServletProperties.REST_pathInfoBlankForNull</c><br>
					Also removed <c>RestRequest.getPathInfo(boolean returnBlankForNull)</c> method which is now redundant with this property.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			New JSON-Schema {@link oaj.dto.jsonschema.JsonSchemaMap} class for supporting linked schemas.
		</li>
		<li>
			Serializers will no longer throw an exception when <c>maxDepth</c> setting is reached, and will instead simply ignore content below the specified depth.<br>
			While the old behavior was as-designed, the new behavior is more in-line with expected behavior.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added support for HTTP header <js>"X-Response-Headers"</js> to <del>RestServlet</del>. <br>
			Allows you to specify one or more headers that should be returned on the response from the servlet.<br>
			For example, to get a page to automatically refresh every 1 second, you can append the following to a URL:  <c>?x-response-headers={Refresh=1}</c>
		</li>
		<li>
			Removed <c>HtmlDocSerializerContext.<jsf>HTML_REFRESH</jsf></c> setting that added a Refresh meta tag to HTML documents, since this can now be controlled through <c>X-Response-Headers</c>.
		</li>
		<li>
			Small improvements to samples.
			<ul>
				<li><c>PhotosResource</c> now includes a default entry.
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
