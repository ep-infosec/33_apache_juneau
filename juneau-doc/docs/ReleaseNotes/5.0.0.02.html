5.0.0.2 (Sept 28, 2012)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.2 is a minor update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Improvements to Javadocs.  Most of the information in the Juno Starters Guide wiki has been moved into the overview and package-level javadocs.<br>
			Since the information is now written in HTML, you can now copy and paste the code examples directly from the Javadocs.<br>
			The code examples are also syntax-highlighted using CSS.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Support for defining default XML namespaces on packages and classes for the XML and RDF serializers.
		</li>
		<li>
			Restructured the packages along content type support (e.g. all JSON support moved to <c>org.apache.juneau.json</c>).
		</li>
		<li>
			Automatic support for parsing maps with <c>Enum</c> keys, and parsing <c>Enum</c> strings.<br>
			This was previously possible using filters but now it's built-in for all the parsers.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Replaced the <c>ObjectList.toXArray()</c> methods with a new <c>elements(Class&lt;T&gt; type)</c> method that's more efficient and avoids creating an unnecessary array.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Support for parsing into beans with read-only properties.<br>
			New <del>@BeanConstructor</del> annotation allows you to specify bean property values to be passed in through a constructor.
		</li>
		<li> 
			Separated the rest library into separate independent client and server libraries.<br>
			Use one, use both, it's up to you.
		</li>
	</ul>
