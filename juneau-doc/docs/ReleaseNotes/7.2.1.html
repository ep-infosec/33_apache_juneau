7.2.1 (Oct 23, 2018)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		This release contains mostly bug fixes.
		Code changes have been made to preserve binary backwards compatibility with 7.1.0.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-marshall</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			The <del>@JsonSchema</del> annotation has been merged with the <del>@Schema</del> annotation.
		<li>
			Annotations typically used on bean properties (getters/setters/public fields) can now be used on private fields.
			This is inline with behavior on JPA-annotated beans.
			These include:  <ja>@Swap</ja>, <ja>@Html</ja>, <ja>@Xml</ja>, <jd>@BeanProperty</jd>.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-server</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Method-level annotations (e.g. <ja>@RestMethod</ja>) and parameter-level annotations (e.g. <ja>@Query</ja>) are now inheritable
			from parent classes and interfaces. 
			<br>This allows you to define <del>RestcDualPurposeInterfaces</del>.
		<li>
			The <c>ReaderResource</c> and <c>StreamResource</c> classes have been moved to the <c>org.apache.juneau.http</c>
			package in <c>juneau-marshall</c>.  This allows them to be used as return types in remote REST interfaces.
			<br>A new <del>ResolvingReaderResource</del> class has been added that includes the variable-resolving support since
			this relies on the <c>juneau-svl</c> package.
		<li>
			The <c>RemoteInterfaceServlet</c> class has been renamed to {@link oajr.remote.RrpcServlet}.
		<li>
			<c><ja>@RestMethod</ja>(name=<js>"PROXY"</js>)</c> has been changed to <c><ja>@RestMethod</ja>(name=<js>"RRPC"</js>)</c>.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>juneau-rest-client</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			The <c>RestClient.getRemoteInterface()</c> method has been renamed to {@link oajrc.RestClient#getRrpcInterface(Class)}.
		<li>
			Fixed a bug where <c><ja>@RemoteMethod</ja>(path)</c> values containing '/' characters were erroneously being encoded.
	</ul>
