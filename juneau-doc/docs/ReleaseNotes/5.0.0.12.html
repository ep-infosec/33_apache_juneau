5.0.0.12 (Mar 10, 2013)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.12 is a minor update.
	</p>
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Core API changes</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Relaxed method naming conventions when using <del>@BeanProperty</del> annotation.<br>
			Methods with zero parameters are interpreted as getters, and methods with one parameter are interpreted as setters.<br>
			Eliminated the <c>BeanProperty.method</c> annotation, since it's now unnecessary.
				</li>
	</ul>		
	<h5 class='topic w800'>REST server API changes</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>		
			Significantly improved response error messages.<br> 
			Older messages were rather cryptic.   Error conditions should be much easier to debug now.
		</li>
		<li>
			New <c>PlainTextRestSerializer</c> class for serializing <js>"plain/text"</js> requests.<br>
			Useful for debugging purposes.
		</li>
		<li>
			<c>Readers</c> and <c>InputStreams</c> can now be passed in as <del>@Content</del> parameters if you need direct access to the HTTP body content without involving the parsers.<br> 
			Equivalent to previously calling {@link oajr.RestRequest#getInputStream()} and {@link oajr.RestRequest#getReader()}.
		</li>
		<li>
			Improved support for the <c>?debug</c> parameter.<br>
			Dumps better information to the log file, such as all header parameters.
		</li>
	</ul>
