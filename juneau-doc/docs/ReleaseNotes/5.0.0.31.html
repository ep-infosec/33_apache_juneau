5.0.0.31 (Aug 9, 2013)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.31 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Simplified the {@link oaj.serializer.Serializer} and {@link oaj.parser.Parser} class hierarchies.<br> 
			This reverses a previous change that added a bunch of interfaces in these APIs (and subsequently required compiling with Java 7 to get around a compiler bug).<br>
			The new class hierarchy is much simpler to understand.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added <del>XMLGregorianCalendarSwap</del> to convert these to ISO8601 strings during serialization, and vice versa during parsing.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added a strict mode to {@link oaj.json.JsonParser}.
		</li>
		<li>
			Added default {@link oaj.json.JsonParser#DEFAULT_STRICT} parser.
		</li>
	</ul>
