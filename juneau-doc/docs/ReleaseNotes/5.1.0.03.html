5.1.0.3 (Jun 28, 2014)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.3 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Core API updates</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Ability to detect and use non-public bean classes, getters/setters, and fields using the following new properties:
			<ul>
				<li><del>BeanContext.BEAN_beanConstructorVisibility</del>- Control which bean constructors are visible to Juno.
				<li><del>BeanContext.BEAN_beanClassVisibility</del>- Control which bean classes are interpreted as beans to Juno.
				<li><del>BeanContext.BEAN_beanFieldVisibility</del>- Control which fields are visible to Juno as bean properties.
				<li><del>BeanContext.BEAN_beanMethodVisibility</del>- Control which getters/setters are visible to Juno as bean properties.
			</ul>
			Removed <c>BeanContext.<jsf>INCLUDE_BEAN_FIELD_PROPERTIES</jsf></c> and <c>BeanContext.<jsf>INCLUDE_BEAN_METHOD_PROPERTIES</jsf></c> properties, since ignoring fields and methods
			can be accomplished by setting the appropriate properties above to {@link oaj.Visibility#NONE NONE}.
			Also, the <del>@BeanProperty</del> annotation can now be used on non-public fields/getters/setters to override
			the default behavior defined by the <c>VISIBILITY</c> properties identified above.  This is a convenient way of identifying protected or
			private fields or methods as bean properties.  Previously, you could only identify public fields/getters/setters using this annotation.
		</li>
		<li>New <del>BeanContext.BEAN_useJavaBeanIntrospector</del> property that lets Juno use the Java bean <c>Introspector</c>
			class to determine bean properties.  In the previous release, the method for determining bean properties was a mixture of Juno-based and Introspector-based.
			Now it's either pure Juno-based or pure Introspector-based.  The result is considerably cleaner code and consistent behavior.
		<li>New {@link oaj.annotation.BeanIgnore @BeanIgnore} annotation.  Replaces the previous <del>@BeanProperty(hidden=true)</del>annotation
			for ignoring bean properties.  Can also be used on classes that look like beans so that they're not treated as beans.
		<li>Support for parsing into non-static member classes.  This applies to all parsers.
		<li>New {@link oaj.json.annotation.Json#wrapperAttr() @Json(wrapperAttr)}	annotation that automatically wraps beans and objects in a wrapper
			attribute when serializing to or parsing from JSON.
		<li>Changed the default ordering of bean properties to be in parent-to-child class order.
		<li>New <del>BeanFilter.readProperty(Object,String,Object) readProperty()</del>and <del>BeanFilter.writeProperty(Object,String,Object) writeProperty()</del>
			methods added to <del>BeanFilter</del>class to allow individualized serialization and parsing behavior on a class-by-class basis.
		<li>Eliminated previous restriction where bean subtype attributes had to be listed first in JSON objects when using the <del>Bean.subTypeProperty()</del>annotation.
			The previous behavior was not strictly JSON-compliant since JSON objects are supposed to consist of unordered lists of key/value pairs.
			While targeted for JSON, the restriction is also lifted for all other parsers.  	
		<li>New fluent-style {@link oaj.BeanMap#load(String) BeanMap.load()} methods for initializing bean maps.
		<li>{@link oaj.html.HtmlDocSerializer} will now embed the data portion of the output in a <c><xt>&lt;div</xt> <xa>id</xa>=<xs>'data'</xs><xt>&gt;</xt></c> element to make it easier to extract the data portion of the page in Javascript in browsers.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>REST Server API updates</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>New <del>RestRequest.getJavaMethod()</del>method for getting access to the method used to handle a request.
			Useful for accessing the method name or annotations during requests, such as in calls to <del>RestGuard.guard(RestRequest,RestResponse)</del>.
		<li>Fixed bug when using Jetty where you tried to read text input after a header was written.
		<li>Added new string variables <dc>$A{...}</dc> (request attributes) and <dc>$P{...}</dc> (request parameters) to <c>RestServlet.createRequestVarResolver(RestRequest)</c>.
	</ul>
