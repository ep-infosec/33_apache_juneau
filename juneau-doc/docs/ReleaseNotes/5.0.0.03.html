5.0.0.3 (Oct 3, 2012)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.3 is a minor update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Support for parsing into read-only beans (i.e. beans with only getters, property values set through constructor args).<br>
			To support this, the <del>@BeanConstructor</del> annotation has been added.
		</li>
		<li>
			Merged separate settings classes back into their base classes (simplifies the API).
		</li>
		<li>
			<del>SerializerGroup SerializerGroups</del> and <del>ParserGroup ParserGroups</del> now share {@link oaj.BeanContext BeanContexts} to reduce memory consumption of class type metadata.	
		</li>	
	</ul>
