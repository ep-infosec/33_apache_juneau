5.1.0.19 (Aug 15, 2015)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.19 is a minor update in terms of core functionality.
		But it introduces a <del>Microservices</del> project for building REST microservices and docker containers.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Core</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Beans can now be serialized to and parsed from <del>ObjectMap ObjectMaps</del>.
			See <dc>Serializing to ObjectMaps</dc> for details.
		<li>New <del>ObjectMap.include(String[])</del>and <del>ObjectMap.exclude(String[])</del>methods.
		<li>{@link oaj.html.annotation.Html @Html} annotations can now be applied to bean properties.
		<li>New <del>IOPipe</del> utility class.
		<li>Behavior change on <del>StringVarResolver</del>.  <jk>null</jk> input now results in blank strings instead of <jk>null</jk>.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Client</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>New <del>RestClient.doCallback(String)</del>method.
	</ul>
	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Server</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>New {@link oajr.RestRequest#getHeaders()} method.
		<li>New <c>RestResponse.getUnbufferedWriter()</c> method.
		<li>Fixed bug that was preventing <c>x-response-headers</c> parameter from working correctly.
		<li>Added {@link oaj.annotation.Bean#properties() @Bean.properties} annotations to the various 
			classes in <c>org.apache.juneau.rest.labels</c> so that the order of the bean properties are consistent
			on all JVMs.  On IBM JVMs this is unnecessary because the order of the properties as defined in the class
			are stored in the bytecode.  Other JVMs such as OpenJRE do not implement this feature causing the bean
			properties to be in random order.
		<li>New <del>ResourceDescription.ResourceDescription(RestRequest,String,String)</del>constructor.
	</ul>
