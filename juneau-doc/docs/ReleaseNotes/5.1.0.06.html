5.1.0.6 (Sept 21, 2014)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.6 is a moderate update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Simplified API for <del>PojoSwap</del>.  
			Since it's rarely used, the <c>beanContext</c> parameter was replaced with a <del>PojoSwap.getBeanContext()</del> method on
			the class.
		<li>New simplified way of defining POJO filters without needing to extend <del>PojoSwap</del>.
			See <del>SurrogateSwap</del> for details.
		<li>New {@link oaj.html.annotation.Html @Html} annotation.
			Will allow the definition of standard XHTML DTOs in future releases.  
			For now, <del>Img</del>is an example of defining an XHTML element using Juno DTOs.
		<li>{@link oaj.json.JsonParser} now ignores trailing <c>';'</c> characters in input so that it can 
			parse strings of the form <js>"var x = {'foo':'bar'};"</js>.
		<li>New <c>TumblrParserResource</c> in the samples war file showing how to combine the REST client and server APIs into a single
			resource in order to download Tumblr blogs and convert the response into any supported response content type.
	</ul>
